thebennybox R&D Experiments

This repository contains several projects that I use for research and 
development or just experimentation. You may use them in accordance with the
license given, but keep in mind this is experimental code. It's primary 
purpose is to try or test something, and it generally isn't designed to be 
used as part of a larger application.

##Additional Credits##
